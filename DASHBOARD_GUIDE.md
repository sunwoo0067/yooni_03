### Understanding Metrics

#### Overview Metrics
- **Total Revenue**: Sum of all completed orders
- **Total Orders**: Count of all orders in the selected period
- **Active Products**: Products currently available for sale
- **API Performance**: Average response time and requests per minute

#### System Health Indicators
- ðŸŸ¢ **Healthy**: All systems operational
- ðŸŸ¡ **Degraded**: Some issues but functional
- ðŸ”´ **Unhealthy**: Critical issues requiring attention

### Managing Alerts

1. **View Alerts**: Click the notification bell icon
2. **Filter Alerts**: Use severity and status filters
3. **Acknowledge**: Mark alert as seen
4. **Resolve**: Mark alert as fixed with resolution notes

### Exporting Data

1. Click the "Export Data" button
2. Select data type (Orders, Products, Revenue, All Metrics)
3. Choose format (CSV, Excel, JSON)
4. Select date range
5. Click "Export" to generate download link

### Performance Optimization Tips

1. **Monitor Error Rates**: Keep error rate below 1%
2. **Watch Response Times**: Target < 200ms average
3. **Check Resource Usage**: Keep CPU < 80%, Memory < 85%
4. **Review Slow Queries**: Optimize database queries > 100ms

## Alert Rules

The system automatically creates alerts based on these conditions:

| Alert Type | Condition | Severity |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| High Error Rate | Error rate > 5% | Critical |
| Slow Response Time | Avg response > 1s | Warning |
| Low Stock | > 10 products low stock | Warning |
| DB Connection Limit | Connections > 90% of max | Warning |
| High Memory Usage | Memory > 85% | Warning |
| API Failures | > 5 failures | Critical |

## Best Practices

1. **Regular Monitoring**
   - Check dashboard daily for trends
   - Review alerts promptly
   - Monitor resource usage during peak times

2. **Proactive Maintenance**
   - Address warnings before they become critical
   - Schedule maintenance during low-traffic periods
   - Keep services updated

3. **Data Analysis**
   - Export data weekly/monthly for trend analysis
   - Compare metrics across different periods
   - Identify seasonal patterns

4. **Alert Management**
   - Don't ignore repeated alerts
   - Document resolution steps
   - Update alert rules based on patterns

## Troubleshooting

### WebSocket Connection Issues
- Check network connectivity
- Verify authentication token
- Look for CORS errors in browser console

### Missing Data
- Verify backend services are running
- Check Redis connection
- Review API response in Network tab

### Performance Issues
- Reduce data point frequency
- Limit chart animations
- Use pagination for large datasets

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: All dashboard endpoints require authentication
2. **Data Privacy**: Sensitive data is encrypted in transit
3. **Export Security**: Download links expire after 1 hour
4. **WebSocket Security**: Connections use secure tokens
